    <!--HTML entities are character sequences that represent special characters or reserved characters that might otherwise be interpreted as HTML code. 
    They are used to display invisible characters or characters that are difficult to generate with a standard keyboard.
    
    HTML entities are written as a piece of text, or string, that begins with an ampersand (&) and ends with a semicolon (;). 
    You can use the htmlEntities() function to convert characters to HTML entities, and the html_entity_decode() function to convert HTML entities back to characters. 
    You can use HTML entities, Unicode, or a combination of both for special characters.  -->
